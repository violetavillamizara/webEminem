      <h2>The beginning</h2>
      <p>Eminem spent his childhood between Missouri and Michigan, settling in Detroit in his teens. At the age of 14, he began rapping with a high school friend, the two adopting the names "Manix" and "M&M," which soon morphed into Eminem. 
        Under this name, Mathers entered battle rapping. Initially, the predominantly Black audience didn't embrace him, but soon his skills gained him a reputation, and he was recruited to join several rap groups.
        <br>
      <p>As he was struggling to establish his career, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim had a daughter, Hailey, forcing him to spend less time rapping and more time providing for his family. 
        He assembled his first album, Infinite, which received some underground attention in 1996, not all of it positive.</p>
        <br>  
        After its release, Eminem developed his Slim Shady alter ego, a persona that freed him to dig deep into his dark id, something he needed as he faced a number of personal upheavals, beginning with a bad split with Kim, which led him to move in with his mother and increase his use of drugs and alcohol, capped off by an unsuccessful suicide attempt. 
        All this sturm und drang was channeled into The Slim Shady EP, which is where he first demonstrated many of the quirks that became his trademark, including his twitchy, nasal rhyming and disturbingly violent imagery.
        The Slim Shady EP opened many doors.</p>

      <h2>Music rise</h2>
      <p>After Eminem came in second at the 1997 Rap Olympics MC Battle in Los Angeles, head Jimmy Iovine sought him out, giving the EP to work with Eminem. They quickly cut Em's debut in the fall of 1998 during which time Marshall reconciled with Kim and married her and The Slim Shady LP appeared early in 1999, preceded by the single "My Name Is."
        <br>
        Both were instant blockbusters and Eminem became a lightning rod for attention, earning praise and disdain for his violent, satirical fantasias. Eminem quickly followed The Slim Shady LP with The Marshall Mathers LP in the summer of 2000. 
        By this point, there was little doubt that Eminem was one of the biggest stars in pop music: the album sold almost two million copies within the first two weeks of release.</p>

      <h2>Controversy</h2>
      <p>This gossip blended with growing criticism about his violent and homophobic lyrics, and under this fire, he reunited his old crew, releasing an album in 2001, then touring with the group. 
        <br>
        During this furor, he had his biggest hit in the form of the moody ballad "Stan." Performed at the Grammys as a duet with the song helped Eminem to cross over to a middlebrow audience, setting the stage for the ultimate crossover of 2001's 8 Mile.
        <br>
        the gritty drama fictionalized Eminem's pre-fame Detroit days and earned considerable praise, culminating in one of his biggest hits with the theme "Lose Yourself," which won Mathers an Oscar.</p>
    
      <h2>Nowadays</h2>
      <p>After all this, he retreated from the spotlight to record his third album, The Eminem Show. Preceded by the single "Without Me," it turned into another huge hit.
        <br>
        At the halftime show of Super Bowl LVI. That June, Eminem released "The King and I," a track he recorded with for the soundtrack of 's biopic, Elvis. "The King and I" was one of three new songs on Curtain Call 2, a July 2022 compilation covering the singles Eminem had released since Curtain Call: The Hits. "From the D to the LBC," a collaboration, was also featured on Curtain Call 2.</p>
